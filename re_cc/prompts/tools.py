"""Tool-specific prompts for the Re-CC application."""

# File operations tools
view_file_prompt = """Reads a file from the local filesystem. The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path. By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file. You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters. Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated. For image files, the tool will display the image for you. For Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), use the ReadNotebook instead."""

edit_file_prompt = """This is a tool for editing files. For moving or renaming files, you should generally use the Bash tool with the 'mv' command instead. For larger edits, use the Write tool to overwrite files. For Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), use the NotebookEditCell instead.

Before using this tool:

1. Use the View tool to understand the file's contents and context

2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):
   - Use the LS tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location

To make a file edit, provide the following:
1. file_path: The absolute path to the file to modify (must be absolute, not relative)
2. old_string: The text to replace (must be unique within the file, and must match the file contents exactly, including all whitespace and indentation)
3. new_string: The edited text to replace the old_string

The tool will replace ONE occurrence of old_string with new_string in the specified file.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:

1. UNIQUENESS: The old_string MUST uniquely identify the specific instance you want to change. This means:
   - Include AT LEAST 3-5 lines of context BEFORE the change point
   - Include AT LEAST 3-5 lines of context AFTER the change point
   - Include all whitespace, indentation, and surrounding code exactly as it appears in the file

2. SINGLE INSTANCE: This tool can only change ONE instance at a time. If you need to change multiple instances:
   - Make separate calls to this tool for each instance
   - Each call must uniquely identify its specific instance using extensive context

3. VERIFICATION: Before using this tool:
   - Check how many instances of the target text exist in the file
   - If multiple instances exist, gather enough context to uniquely identify each one
   - Plan separate tool calls for each instance

WARNING: If you do not follow these requirements:
   - The tool will fail if old_string matches multiple locations
   - The tool will fail if old_string doesn't match exactly (including whitespace)
   - You may change the wrong instance if you don't include enough context

When making edits:
   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code
   - Do not leave the code in a broken state
   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)

If you want to create a new file, use:
   - A new file path, including dir name if needed
   - An empty old_string
   - The new file's contents as new_string

Remember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each."""

create_file_prompt = """Creates a new file with the specified content. The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path.

Before using this tool:

1. Verify the directory path is correct:
   - Use the LS tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location

2. Consider if the file already exists:
   - If it might, check using the View tool first

3. Ensure file path is absolute:
   - Must start with / (root) or use full path from root"""

ls_prompt = """Lists files and directories in a given path. The path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path. You can optionally provide an array of glob patterns to ignore with the ignore parameter. You should generally prefer the Glob and Grep tools, if you know which directories to search."""

# Search tools
glob_tool_prompt = """Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size.
- Supports glob patterns like "**/*.js" or "src/**/*.ts"
- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time
- Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns
- When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Agent tool instead"""

grep_tool_prompt = """Fast content search tool that works with any codebase size.
- Searches file contents using regular expressions
- Supports full regex syntax (eg. "log.*Error", "function\\s+\\w+", etc.)
- Filter files by pattern with the include parameter (eg. "*.js", "*.{ts,tsx}")
- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time
- Use this tool when you need to find files containing specific patterns
- When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Agent tool instead"""

# Command execution tools
bash_tool_prompt = """Executes a given bash command in a persistent shell session with optional timeout, ensuring proper handling and security measures.

Before executing the command, please follow these steps:

1. Directory Verification:
   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use the LS tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location
   - For example, before running "mkdir foo/bar", first use LS to check that "foo" exists and is the intended parent directory

2. Security Check:
   - For security and to limit the threat of a prompt injection attack, some commands are limited or banned. If you use a disallowed command, you will receive an error message explaining the restriction. Explain the error to the User.
   - Verify that the command is not one of the banned commands: alias, curl, curlie, wget, axel, aria2c, nc, telnet, lynx, w3m, links, httpie, xh, http-prompt, chrome, firefox, safari.

3. Command Execution:
   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.
   - Capture the output of the command.

Usage notes:
  - The command argument is required.
  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 30 minutes.
- If the output exceeds 30000 characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.
  - VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like `find` and `grep`. Instead use GrepTool, GlobTool, or dispatch_agent to search. You MUST avoid read tools like `cat`, `head`, `tail`, and `ls`, and use View and LS to read files.
  - When issuing multiple commands, use the ';' or '&&' operator to separate them. DO NOT use newlines (newlines are ok in quoted strings).
  - IMPORTANT: All commands share the same shell session. Shell state (environment variables, virtual environments, current directory, etc.) persist between commands. For example, if you set an environment variable as part of a command, the environment variable will persist for subsequent commands.
  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.
  <good-example>
  pytest /foo/bar/tests
  </good-example>
  <bad-example>
  cd /foo/bar && pytest tests
  </bad-example>"""

# Agent tools
dispatch_agent_prompt = """Launch a new agent that has access to various tools. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match on the first try, use the Agent tool to perform the search for you. For example:

- If you are searching for a keyword like "config" or "logger", or for questions like "which file does X?", the Agent tool is strongly recommended
- If you want to read a specific file path, use the View or GlobTool tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for a specific class definition like "class Foo", use the GlobTool tool instead, to find the match more quickly

Usage notes:
1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses
2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.
3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.
4. The agent's outputs should generally be trusted
5. IMPORTANT: The agent can not use Bash, Replace, Edit, NotebookEditCell, so can not modify files. If you want to use these tools, use them directly instead of going through the agent."""

# Notebook tools
notebook_read_prompt = """Reads a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) and returns all of the cells with their outputs. Jupyter notebooks are interactive documents that combine code, text, and visualizations, commonly used for data analysis and scientific computing.

notebook_edit_prompt = """Completely replaces the contents of a specific cell in a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) with new source.
